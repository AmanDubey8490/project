Hi, I’ve uploaded a data-cleaning project using MySQL.
Inside the repository, there’s a folder called ‘data cleaning’ containing three SQL files:

sales_data_uncleaned.sql – the raw, messy dataset.

sample_data_cleaned.sql – the exact SQL queries I used to clean the data, including removing duplicates, handling NULL values, filling missing fields, and other transformations.

sales_data_cleaned.sql – the final cleaned dataset exported after applying all the steps.

This project shows the full end-to-end cleaning process.
Take a look and see how the uncleaned data was transformed into a clean, usable dataset.
Thanks for checking it out.
